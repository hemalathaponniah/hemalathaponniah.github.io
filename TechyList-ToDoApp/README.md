## User Story
As a project Manager I would like to use 'To-Do App' to assign task to my team members.
I want an application that can monitor and track the progress of the task performed by team members. 
In addition to this feature, the team members can update the status of the task and also can delete the task when it is needed.
I want the task to be saved to local storage, if the page is refreshed then  the task is still rendered on the browser.
